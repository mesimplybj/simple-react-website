This is an example of simple react website. I have tried to make the project as simple as possible but with dynamic content as much as possible

[DEMO: https://react-website-template.herokuapp.com](https://react-website-template.herokuapp.com/)

# Phases

### 1st Phase: Static Portfolio

Just raw HTML and CSS integrated in the react app [dataconstant branch](https://github.com/mesimplybj/simple-react-website/tree/dataconstant). You can download this branch and run the project and get the output directly

### 2nd Phase: Static Portfolio using API data

All the data are consumed from the API but still the data in API are constant.

### 3rd Stage : Dynamic Portfolio using API

The  data are integrated from API and also dashboard is developed to change the data
